# ToDos

1. Beef up Tests. Getting familiar with the data set and refamiliar with Python conventions took a bit, so much to do here as I'm sure there are plenty of failure cases to handle.
2. Reorganize project. Need to familiarize myself with package and module best practices for both convention-sake and for distrobution
3. Automate / Extend some of the data fetching so the data file doesn't need to be embedded and get out of date quickly
